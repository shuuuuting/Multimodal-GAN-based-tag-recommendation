# Multimodal-GAN-based-tag-recommendation
	We propose an innovative hybrid GAN-recommendation method combining pretrained feature extraction model, co-attention mechanism and new sampling strategy in the GAN structure. 
	Our model takes multimodal data into consideration to cover the shortage of using single modality data and adopt a novel co-attention mechanism to effectively combine multimodal data including text, image, group, and title information in the generator. 
	We design a novel sampling strategy to reweight sample probability in order to improve Generator and Discriminator’s training performance.
	We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method through a real-world dataset, and the result shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art methods.
