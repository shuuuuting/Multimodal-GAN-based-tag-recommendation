# Multimodal-GAN-based-tag-recommendation
- An innovative hybrid GAN-recommendation method combining pretrained feature extraction model, co-attention mechanism and new sampling strategy in the GAN structure. 
- Our model takes multimodal data into consideration to cover the shortage of using single modality data and adopt a novel co-attention mechanism to effectively combine multimodal data including text, image, group, and title information in the generator. 
- A novel sampling strategy to reweight sample probability in order to improve Generator and Discriminatorâ€™s training performance.
